"""Advanced Task 2: Budget Breakdown
- Ask for three separate expense amounts (for example: travel, food, accommodation).
- Convert each input so you can add them together to get a total trip cost.
- Calculate the average spend per category and show each value with an f-string.
- Extension: format the totals so they always show two decimal places.
