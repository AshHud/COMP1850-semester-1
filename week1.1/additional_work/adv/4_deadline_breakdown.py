"""Advanced Task 4: Deadline Breakdown
- Ask how many minutes remain until an assignment deadline.
- Use integer division and modulo to convert this number into days, hours, and minutes.
- Present the result using a formatted string such as "2 days, 3 hours, 15 minutes remaining".
- Extension: handle negative input by printing a warning that the deadline has already passed.
